# Credit Card Scoring Analysis
This repository contains the analysis and modeling code for a credit card scoring project. The goal of the project is to predict whether an applicant for a credit card will default on their payments or not. The analysis and modeling are based on a dataset of credit card applicants, which includes various features such as age, income, and credit history.

### Getting Started
To run the analysis and modeling code, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with the following packages:

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
You can install these packages using pip, a Python package manager. To install them, run the following command:
          pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a publicly available dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about credit card applicants, including demographic information and credit history, as well as whether or not they defaulted on their payments.

### Analysis and Modeling
The analysis and modeling are performed in a Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains the following sections:

- Data Exploration: In this section, we explore the dataset and visualize the distributions of the features.
- Feature Engineering: In this section, we engineer new features based on the existing features in the dataset.
- Data Preprocessing: In this section, we preprocess the data by scaling the features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Modeling: In this section, we train several machine learning models on the training data and evaluate their performance on the testing data.
- Model Selection: In this section, we select the best performing model and tune its hyperparameters.
- Final Model: In this section, we train the final model on the entire dataset and save it for deployment.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 85% on the testing data. This model can be used to predict whether an applicant for a credit card is likely to default on their payments or not.
